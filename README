My attempt to write a minimal shell for GNU+Linux environment

What I wish to implement

1. Bare minimum to take a command with arguments from stdin and spawn a child process to execute it.
2. Abitlity to redirect I/O to files
3. Ability to chain multiple commands using pipes
4. Run the children in background it & is specified at the end of the commands
5. !! can run the previous command again

Note :
I will obviously skip checks everywhere. Code will assume a lot of stuff and its okay. My only aim is to learn how child processes are spawned and how pipes work.
